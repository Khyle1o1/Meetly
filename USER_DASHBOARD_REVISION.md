# User Dashboard Revision

## Overview

The user dashboard has been completely revised to show only the following features for non-admin users:

### ðŸ‘¤ Logged-in User View (Non-Admin)

#### ðŸŸ¢ 1. Available Events to Book
- Fetches and displays all available events that are open for booking
- Each event card shows:
  - Event title
  - Duration
  - Availability range (dates)
  - A "Book Now" button

#### ðŸ“© 2. Pending Bookings
- Shows a list of pending bookings that are waiting for admin approval
- Displays booking details including event, date, time, and status
- "View Details" button navigates to the booking details page

#### ðŸ”„ 3. Auto-Resume Flow
- When the user logs in, checks if they have any pending bookings
- If yes, prompts them to view their pending booking details
- If not, shows the available events list by default

## Backend Changes

## Testing

A test script has been created at `backend/test-user-dashboard.js` to verify the new endpoints work correctly.

- Users cannot see their own events in the available events list
- Proper authorization checks are in place
